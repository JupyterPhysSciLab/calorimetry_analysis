# Calorimetry Analysis
## Introduction
This tool provides a graphical user interface if used in Jupyter for 
analyzing temperature versus time data sets from calorimetry experiments. 
The tool estimates the impact of heat leakage and stirring by fitting lines 
to the regions immediately before and after the temperature change. See the 
documentation (TODO) for details.

## Installation
```commandline
pip install calorimetry-analysis
```
